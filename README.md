A simple questions tracker written in Meteor.

The purpose of this app is to allow an audience during a talk/dialog session to submit their questions to the speakers who may be holding a portable device such as a smart phone or tablet, as well as to a display such as a projector, in real time.
At the moment public users will only be able to see questions which have been approved by users who are currently logged in (role based accounts not yet implemented).

This is my first Meteor app so do let me know if I did anything the "wrong" way.
